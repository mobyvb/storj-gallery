# Storj Gallery
A web app that uses [Storj.js](https://github.com/Storj/storj.js) to upload and download files to and from the Storj network in the browser.

## Building and Running Locally
* Clone this repository
* From the newly created `storj-gallery` folder, run `npm install`, then `npm run build`
* If you want to automatically build every time a file in the app directory is modified, use `npm run build -- --watch`
* Once the project is built, opening [src/client/index.html](./src/client/index.html) in a browser will allow you to use the webapp
